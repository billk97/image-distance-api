# image-distance-api

## Description
This is a flask api wich can calculate the distance between the camera and a pre diffined object.

## How it works
An image is used as a reference image. From this image we insert the distance in witch we took the picture in centimiters
and the dimentions of the object. With this we can calculate the focal of the cammera lense. After that we probide throw 
the api an image wich we want to calculate the distance of and we have an estimation.
